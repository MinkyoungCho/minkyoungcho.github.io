[{"content":"I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Z. Morley Mao.\nMy primary research interests lie in multi-modal, efficient AI, and robust AI.\nIâ€™m particularly passionate about understanding what makes multi-modal models uniqueâ€”especially through the lens of interpretabilityâ€”by focusing on how to effectively and efficiently reconcile different modalities/agents. I also find great fulfillment in enhancing the efficiency \u0026amp; robustness of these models ðŸ˜ƒ!\n","date":"Sep 22 2025","permalink":"/","section":"Introduction","summary":"I am a fourth-year Ph.","title":"Introduction"},{"content":"","date":"Sep 22 2025","permalink":"/news/","section":"News","summary":"","title":"News"},{"content":"Stay tuned for additional updates :)\n","date":"Sep 22 2025","permalink":"/news/20250922-neuripsw25/","section":"News","summary":"Stay tuned for additional updates :)","title":"One Paper Accepted to NeurIPSW'25"},{"content":"We propose a robust, holistic 3D perception framework in a collaborative setting among multiple AVs.
